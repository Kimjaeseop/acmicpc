My program seems to always exit after reading one line.

Shouldn't it only halt when a line ends with an exclamation mark?

After reading a line, I check the last character using a switch.

When the character is a period, I print "*Nod*".

When the character is a question mark, I print "Quack!".

Wait, both get printed before the program exits?

I guess I forgot to add break; here and there...

I quacked the code!
