In the loop, I read a line of input.

The method std::getline(std::cin, line); reads until a newline, right?

Then I branch according to the last character of the line of input.

When the last character is an exclamation mark, I simply terminate the program.

When the last character is a question mark, I need to print "Quack!" right?

In any other case, I simply print "*Nod*".

Wait, to flush the output stream I need to use std::endl instead of '\n' right?

I quacked the code!
